## PREPOCESSING STEP THAT IS IMPORTANT TO REMEMBER:
to make the huge amount of modding and beatmap combinations managable and avoid **item-explosion**. The following steps were taken.
1. Parsed the Bitmasks into human readable format (a string set)
2. Filtered out all rows where difficulty/map/pp altering Mods were used, except for the competetively viable (and most common) ones.
3. Merged all "preference" mods if used, that change gameplay only a little into the remaining 4 main categories:  
**NM**(No Mod),**DT**(Double Time), **HR**(Hard Rock), **DTHR**(Double Time + Hardrock)  
    - **HD**(Hidden) was also collapsed, it changes diff and pp slightly, and is widely used. The max,pp score was kept in the collapsing. 

4. treat each beatmap_id + Mod_string combination as a unique item and assign a new "item id": *mod_beatmap_id*

## üìÅ `beatmaps.csv`



Each row represents a unique combination of a **beatmap** and a **mod configuration**

| Column | Description |
|--------|-------------|
| `mod_beatmap_id` | Unique hash ID for a specific beatmap and modification combination. | 
| `beatmap_id` | Original beatmap ID in osu!. |

| `aim`, `speed` | dynmically calculated from mapping data, represent something similar to distance of hit objects and hits/per second required |
| `max_combo` | Maximum combo possible. |
| `strain` | Overall difficulty strain of the beatmap, usually a weighted combination of aim and speed strains. rolling windows of aim and speed difficulty. (since these may vary over the map)
| `slider_factor` | Ratio of sliders to total hit objects.
| `speed_note_count` | Number of notes that appear in quick succession and are considered to contribute to speed difficulty. Typically counts note pairs where the time between them is below a threshold (e.g., 200 ms). |
| `genre` | Genre of the song. |
| `language` | Language of the lyrics or theme. |

## üìÅ `scores.csv`

Each row represents the best score a user playing a specific beatmap with a specific modification achieved.

Each row represents an **osu! player profile**.

| Column | Description |
|--------|-------------|

### Nice to have, if possible obtain these when i have the time and a way without the osu api banning me:
- max pp of a beatmap_mod id
- liked beatmap- sets of users
- exist/failrate on beatmap
