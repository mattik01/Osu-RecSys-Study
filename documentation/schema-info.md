## PREPOCESSING STEP THAT IS IMPORTANT TO REMEMBER:
to make the huge amount of modding and beatmap combinations managable and avoid **item-explosion**. The following steps were taken.
1. Parsed the Bitmasks into human readable format (a string set)
2. Filtered out all rows where difficulty/map/pp altering Mods were used, except for the competetively viable (and most common) ones.
3. Merged all "preference" mods if used, that change gameplay only a little into the remaining 4 main categories:  
**NM**(No Mod),**DT**(Double Time), **HR**(Hard Rock), **DTHR**(Double Time + Hardrock)  
    - **HD**(Hidden) was also collapsed, it changes diff and pp slightly, and is widely used. The max,pp score was kept in the collapsing. 

4. treat each beatmap_id + Mod_string combination as a unique item and assign a new "item id": *mod_beatmap_id*

- **Export Tables:**
  - Only includes beatmaps with complete `diff_` attributes for all relevant mod combinations.
  - `524,496 = 131,124 beatmaps √ó 4 mod combinations` (for Random).

- **Processed Scores:**
  - Filtering applied based on:
    - Beatmap-mod relevant combinations.
    - diff attribute completeness.




## üéØ Enjoyment Factor Calculation


Each score is assigned an **enjoyment score** between 0 and 1 (most lie in the 0.1‚Äì0.5 range).  
This factor is necessarily somewhat arbitrary, as its computed from implicit feedback only. It was designed from experience and checked to be meaningful and reasonably balanced through visualization and inspection of values (see `dataprocessor` and `analysis`).  

!!! At different points ALL components are normailzed to ranges between 0 and 1, usually on a per user basis, to keep them comparable. 

!!! At all relevant points, only data from the top/random dataset is seperated and used individually.

```
enjoyment = 
0.2 * playcount_component +
0.4 * favourite_component +
0.2 * accuracy_component * (1 - farm_factor) +
0.2 * pp_contribution_component * farm_factor
```
(if the map is farmy, value pp_contribution more; if not, value accuracy more)  
  
*All enjoyment scores are baseline- and variance-adjusted (zero mean, unit variance) **per user** afterwards.*

- **playcount_component(user, beatmap, mods)** =  `1 - exp(-user_playcount_on_beatmap / average_global_playcount)`  
  ‚Üí decaying scaling, saturation point around playcount average, normalized per-user to [0, 1]

- **favourite_component(beatmapset)** =  `favourite_count / total_playcount`  
  ‚Üí global explicit positive feedback percentage for beatmapset

- **accuracy_component(score)** =  `1 - (accuracy - 0.95)^2`  
  ‚Üí soft accuracy target of 95%

- **pp_contribution_component(score, user)** = `score_pp / user_total_weighted_pp`  
  ‚Üí normalized per-user to [0, 1]

- **farm_factor(beatmap)** = `0.2 * compactness + 0.8 * pp_contribution_global`

  - **compactness** = `mean(pp) / max(pp)`  
    ‚Üí higher if all scores on the beatmap reach close to the maximum pp  

  - **pp_contribution_global** =  `(sum of true_pp across all top scores using this beatmap) / total_playcount`  
    ‚Üí global true pp contribution by playcount  

  - **true_pp(score)** =  `pp * 0.95^rank(score)`  
    ‚Üí official osu score contribution formula to the user's weighted pp list

### Nice to have, if possible obtain these when i have the time and a way without the osu api banning me:
- max pp of a beatmap_mod id (not in osu api, possibly in third party)
- liked beatmap- sets of users (seems impossible)
- exist/failrate on beatmap
