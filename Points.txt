Points:

Proposal (max. 8):  7

Data analysis (max. 6):   6 
(We have a lot of cool stuff here, unfortunately we were barely 
able to show it due to time and the missed presentation)

RecSys development (max. 16): 12
passable pipeline, we also count all the data preparation and feature engineering (75% of what we did in effort)

Evaluation and tuning (max. 10): 5
lackluster.
